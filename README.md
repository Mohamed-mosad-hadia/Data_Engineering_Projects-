# 🚀 **My Data Engineering Journey**  

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m **Mohamed Mosaad**, a **Computer Science graduate** and aspiring **Data Engineer** passionate about building **reliable data pipelines**, optimizing **ETL processes**, and creating **data-driven solutions**.

## 📂 **MySQL Database Projects**  

This repository contains multiple **database design and implementation projects** developed as part of my **data engineering journey**.  
Each project follows a complete workflow:  

✅ **Problem Analysis** – Understanding business requirements  
✅ **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** – Designing relationships between entities  
✅ **Normalization** – Applying 1NF, 2NF, 3NF for optimized schema  
✅ **Implementation in MySQL** – Creating normalized tables, constraints, and relationships  
✅ **Query Writing** – CRUD operations, joins, and complex reports

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**  
- 🗄 **Database**: MySQL  
- 🧩 **Modeling**: ERD diagrams (Draw.io, Lucidchart, etc.)  
- 📐 **Normalization**: Up to **3NF**  
- 💻 **Environment**: MySQL Workbench / Command Line

## ⭐ **What Makes These Projects Stand Out**  
✔ Complete **Database Design Lifecycle**: *Problem → ERD → Normalization → Implementation → Queries*  
✔ Focus on **best practices in relational database design**  
✔ Real-world inspired **business use cases**
